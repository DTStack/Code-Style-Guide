# Code Style Guide

> Our project is based on the [airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and [TypeScript style guide](https://ts.dev/style/#identifiers) project fork to adapt the specification for the Dtstack Frontend Team.
> Compared to the original, it integrates the Dtstack Frontend Team specification, adds the latest JS and React features, and unit testing.
> We plan to sort out a set of corresponding link rules according to the specifications in the future and integrate them into our projects for actual production and development.

## Code Style guide directory

  - [React](react/README.md)
  - [CSS-in-JavaScript](css-in-javascript/README.md)
  - [CSS & Sass](css-sass/README.md)
  - [Javascript](javascript/README.md)

## Why do need a code style guide

Because software is often written by different people throughout its life cycle. If everyone follows the specification, everyone's code style will be consistent.

## What can a code style guide doï¼Ÿ

  - Disciplined code promotes teamwork
  - Regular code can reduce bug handling
  - Regular code can reduce maintenance costs
  - Normative code facilitates code review
  - Getting into the habit of code specification helps programmers grow
